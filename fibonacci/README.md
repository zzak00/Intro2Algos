# Generating function and Fibonacci numbers

According to Wikipedia, [Generating fuctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function) is a way of encoding an infinite sequence of numbers (an) by treating them as the coefficients of a formal power series.

## The Fibonacci Sequence as a Power Series

Recall that the Fibonacci numbers are defined by the recurrence relation <br>
Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2     &nbsp; for n≥2, with F0=0 and F1=1.

Let define the generating function for the Fibonacci numbers as follows:

and prove that: 
F(x)=x+x.F(x)+x^2.F(x)
Solving for the generating function, we get:
F(x)=x1−x−x2.
